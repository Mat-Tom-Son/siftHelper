Because patients matter - because PEOPLE matter - and because I know we can always do better. \nAs an individual in the engineering and life sciences consulting sector, I seek to always grow in exposure to and development of new processes, novel solutions, and innovative approaches to solving the challenges of the biomechanical field we face today. With a foundation built from a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a Biology minor, and supported by a Master's in Biomedical Engineering, I strive to continue my development as a T-shaped teammate on every project I am able to be a part of.",
